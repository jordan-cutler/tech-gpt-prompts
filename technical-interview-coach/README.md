# How to setup Technical Interview Coach

1. Pick your favorite foundational LLM and leverage the "custom instructions"/"persona" feature (eg: [Chat GPT Custom Prompt Walkthrough](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8096356-chatgpt-custom-instructions-faq), [Claude](https://claude.ai/projects), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/gems/view)). For this prompt, I personally went with Gemini for my usage here since configuring gems is the most straightforward. If you are a student in university, [Gemini offers 1 year of Pro tier for free](https://gemini.google/students/?utm_source=gemini&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_campaign=students_sem_bts-sem_generic__text&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22867540490&gbraid=0AAAAAC_C9PTmgFANxf7l4vWFcNs7gUt4k&gclid=CjwKCAjw2vTFBhAuEiwAFaScwoKsTGt1UVt1lAGPfQBqPtk5c_Bp2-3eYapr2RL2avDM7xDh8B2FsRoC_8oQAvD_BwE).

2. Add the prompt under the `tech-gpt-prompts/technical-interview-coach/tech-interview-coach-by-karthik-subramanian.md` directory to the gem/pre-seeded context. FYI, feel free to customize the level which the persona should evaluate you against based on the level of seniority you are targeting for in the prompt itself. You will only need to change a few words
   
3. Interact with the persona
