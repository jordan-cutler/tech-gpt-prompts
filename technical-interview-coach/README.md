# How to setup Technical Interview Coach

1. Pick your favorite foundational LLM (eg: Chat GPT, Claude, Gemini). I personally went with Gemini for my usage here since configuring gems is really easy here. If you are a student in university, Gemini offers 1 year of Pro tier for free
2. Add the prompt under the `tech-gpt-prompts/technical-interview-coach/tech-interview-coach-prompt.md` directory to the gem/pre-seeded context. FYI, feel free to customize the level which the persona should evaluate you against based on the level of seniority you are targeting for
3. Interact with the persona
