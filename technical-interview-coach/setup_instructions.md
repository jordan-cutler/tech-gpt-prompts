# How to setup Technical Interview Coach

1. Pick your favorite foundational LLM (eg: Chat GPT, Claude, Gemini). I personally went with Gemini for my usage here since configuring gems is really easy here. If you are a student in university, Gemini offers 1 year of Pro tier for free
2. Add the prompt under the `tech-gpt-prompts/technical-interview-coach` directory to the gem/pre-seeded context
3. Interact with the persona
